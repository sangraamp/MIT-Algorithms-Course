# MIT-Algorithms-Course
These are my solutions to the problem sets of the MIT Algorithms course offered by MIT OCW. In case you are here to verify my resume, the ps3 folder is the folder where I implemented the sweep line algorithm and modified the Range Index using an augmented AVL tree. The code is in circuit2.py

<code>ps2</code> : 

      In this problem set, we were introduced to the concepts of 2D and 3D fractal rendering 
      and were asked to calculate the tightest asymptotic bounds for the fractal rendering algorithm to render a Koch snowflake.

      In the second part of this problem set, the task was to speedup a digital circuit simulator. 
      The circuit simulator takes an input file that describes a circuit layout, including gatesâ€™ delays,
      probes (indicating the gates that we want to monitor the output), and external inputs. 
      It then simulates the transitions at the output terminals of all the gates as time progresses. 
      It also outputs transitions at the probed gates in the order of the timing of those transitions.
      
      The task included profiling the code, finding the performance bottleneck, understanding the reason behind
      it, and removing the bottleneck by optimizing the code.
      
      The solution demanded implementing a more efficient data structure, the Priority Queue, from scratch, using Min Heap.
      
       
<code>ps3</code> :

      In this problem set, we had to implement an efficient sweep line algorithm, to find potential intersections between wires
      in a logic gate circuit layout.
      We were introduced to the Range Index ADT and had to implement it efficiently using (augmented) AVL trees.
